# Textimonials-grid
Frontend Mentor is a website where front-end developers get a design and are asked to make it into a page to practice their skills. This repository is my approach for the following design: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7

**I do not own this design. If you've any questions related to it you should clarify them in the Frontend Mentor website.** 
## CSS features used in this project:
**Grid:** This website is a perfect example of an scenario where Grid becomes very useful (A grid with multiple AR that changes it's arrangement depending on the current viewport width). Grid areas makes quick work of making responsive grids. 
**Flexbox:** I mainly use CSS Flexbox for my projects since it's simpler and quicker to use than CSS Grid. The only exception being really problematic situations where you need to force two objects on top of eachother, or really complex grids with multiple aspect ratios.  
**Variables:** CSS Variables make it way simpler to work with colors, font weights, font sizes, font familys, and shadows. I completely recommend to anyone learning CSS to master them.
